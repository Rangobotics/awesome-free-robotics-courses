- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com) (AP style).
- Use the following format: `[List Name](link)`
- If you feel like you can improve the list (for instance by adding categories), please make a suggestion.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
